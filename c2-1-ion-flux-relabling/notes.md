## 1. Identify

Go to youtube and understand what a binary tree is before tying to understand the question. 

Binary tree -> each child has 2 nodes at most

**Perfect Binary Tree** -> Each level is filled, and each node has 0 or 2 children. 

Balanced trees = better performance = the left and right tree of each node cannot be more than 1 height apart!

MATHS

leaf nodes = nodes w/ 2 children + 1

max_nodes_at_level = 2^(L-1) where L is the level relative to the top. 

e.g.

1 = 2^(1-1)

2 = 2^(2-1)

4 = 2^(3-1)

etc...

max_nodes = 2^(H + 1) -1  where H is tree height

1 = 2^(0 + 1) -1

3 = 2^(1 + 1) -1

7 = 2^(2 + 1) -1

15 = 2^(3 + 1) -1

etc...


**Binary Tree Uses:** Binary tree search, Binary heap
### problem



### benefit
The doomsday device is working again, so we can continue to be EVIL. 
### goal
Rebuild the ion flux converter





##  2. Research


**Past Solution**
1. Perform post-order traversal of the the tree of *converters*
2. Label each *converter* with it's order in the traversal, starting with 1. 

e.g. 7 converter tree
7
3 6 
1 2 4 5

**post-order-traversal**

**perfect binary trees**

How I solved it:

1. Read problem
2. researched binary trees https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAAZixBzIAI&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
3. wrote psuedocode for inputs and outputs
4. defined problem
5. Took a brain break
